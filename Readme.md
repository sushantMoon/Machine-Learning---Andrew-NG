# Machine Learning by Andrew NG

* This repo has the work done by me under the course Machine Learning offered by Coursera by Dr. Andrew NG.
* This is just for my personal reference/educational purpose.
* I urge fellow ML enthusiast not to copy any materials and honor the Course Rules.
* I do not promote any kind of plagarism as the course rules dictates, and encourage users to dedicatedly solve the assignments.
